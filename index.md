Course-in-a-Box claims to be "a free tool for building and publishing online coursesâ€”no prior coding experience required."

And though I would not call editing some Markdown and yml files "coding" *per se*, it is a very different way of thinking about things than using a Word Processor or a WYSIWYG site builder like Google Sites.

It is likely that you will not be willing to use Jekyll, but I think that seeing a bit about how it works will help you to understand some things about how computers and computer programs work.
